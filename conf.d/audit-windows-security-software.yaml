    This shows results coming from Windows Security Center.  Exactly how different products use SC is a bit of mystery, but for clients using Microsoft Defender, this should give reliable data.
    For ProductState (not ProductStatus -- sorry for the confusing names -- they come from Micorosft)
      **IF OUTPUT IS BLANK - NO ANTI VIRUS IS INSTALLED OR REQUIRES MANUAL CHECK**.  If that happens, you might also review the running process list (System_RunningProcesses) to see if you can find the A/V binaries.  This would at least provide that A/V is running, even if other details need to tested manually.

      Other antivirus products will need to be researched
    For the other fields: These are known to provide good data for Microsoft Defender.  For other products, they could entirely unreliable.  For Defender, these field names should be self-explanatory, but https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/desktop/defender/msft-mpcomputerstatus has some more details on what the fields mean.
