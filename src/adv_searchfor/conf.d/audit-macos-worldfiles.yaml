    This is a filtered list of files that are writable by any user on the system.  We're focusing on files that are in the following locations, as recommended by the CIS MacOS 13 Benchmark.

    File system permissions are grouped into four parts:
      - A flag -- this might be a "d" for directory, a "-" for nothing (i.e. a file), and maybe some more (we're only going to see "d" or "blank" in these results)
      - User -- a set of "rwx-"" for "read", "write", "execute" and "none" for what the user who owns the file/directory can do
      - Group -- same as above, but this time for the group owner of the file.  See "etc_group" for group names and members
      - World -- same as above, but this time for anyone who's not an owner or in a group.  These are the interesting things we're exposing in this list. 
    
    Locations:
      - /System/Volumes/Data/System -- Operating system files, but sometimes applications insist on being installed here.  To quote the CIS Benchmark directly: "Macs with writable files in System should be investigated forensically. A file with open writable permissions is a sign of at best a rogue application. It could also be a sign of a computer compromise and a persistent presence on the system."
      - /Applications -- All system-wide installed applications.  World-writable application folders would allow any user to update the application files, including installing malicious software instead.
      - /System/Data/System/Library -- System-wide configurations, but sometimes applications insist on being installed here.  You can safely ignore any folders that include "Cache" or "Preferences/Audio/Data".
