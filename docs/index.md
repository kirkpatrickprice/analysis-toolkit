# KP Analysis Toolkit

Welcome to the KP Analysis Toolkit documentation! This comprehensive Python application is designed to assist auditors with analyzing and processing various types of data encountered during security assessments.

## Overview

The toolkit currently includes three main modules:

### üîç Process Scripts
Formerly known as `adv-searchfor`, this module processes text files generated by KirkpatrickPrice's OS-specific collection scripts. It provides flexible search capabilities, automated analysis, and comprehensive reporting through Excel workbooks.

**Supported Collection Scripts:**

- [Linux Audit Scripts](https://github.com/kirkpatrickprice/linux-audit-scripts)
- [Windows Audit Scripts](https://github.com/kirkpatrickprice/windows-audit-scripts)  
- [MacOS Auditor](https://github.com/kirkpatrickprice/macos-auditor)

### üîß Nipper Expander

A specialized tool for processing Nipper CSV export files. It transforms Nipper's compact CSV format (where multiple devices may be listed in a single row) into an expanded format with one row per device per finding, making it easier to analyze vulnerabilities using Excel pivot tables and other analysis tools.

### üìÑ RTF to Text Converter

Converts Rich Text Format (RTF) files to plain text files using ASCII encoding. This is particularly useful when customers provide router/firewall configurations as RTF documents instead of plaintext files.
