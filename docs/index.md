# KP Analysis Toolkit

Welcome to the KP Analysis Toolkit documentation! This Python toolkit assists auditors with analyzing and processing various types of data encountered during security assessments.

## Toolkit Modules

The toolkit includes three specialized modules for different data analysis tasks:

### üîç Process Scripts
Processes text files generated by KirkpatrickPrice's OS-specific collection scripts. Features flexible search capabilities, automated analysis, and detailed reporting through Excel workbooks.

**NOTE** This is tool is the new and significantly improved replacement for `adv-searchfor`.

**Data Sources:**

- [Linux Audit Scripts](https://github.com/kirkpatrickprice/linux-audit-scripts)
- [Windows Audit Scripts](https://github.com/kirkpatrickprice/windows-audit-scripts)  
- [MacOS Auditor](https://github.com/kirkpatrickprice/macos-auditor)

**Key Features:**

- Pattern-based searching with customizable configurations
- Automated Excel report generation with pivot tables
- Support for multiple file formats and encodings
- Configurable analysis rules via YAML files

**üìñ [Process Scripts Guide](user-guides/process-scripts.md)** - Setup, configuration, and advanced usage

### üîß Nipper Expander
Transforms Nipper CSV export files from compact format (multiple devices per row) into expanded format (one row per device per finding). This transformation makes vulnerability analysis significantly easier using Excel pivot tables and filtering.

**Key Features:**

- Automatic CSV file detection
- Device-specific vulnerability expansion
- Preservation of all original data fields
- Excel-friendly output formatting

**üìñ [Nipper Expander Guide](user-guides/nipper-expander.md)** - File processing and analysis workflows

### üìÑ RTF to Text Converter
Converts Rich Text Format (RTF) files to plain text files using ASCII encoding. Essential when router/firewall configurations are provided as RTF documents instead of plaintext files.

**Key Features:**

- Batch processing capabilities
- Directory scanning for RTF files
- Encoding standardization
- Error handling for corrupted files

**üìñ [RTF Converter Guide](user-guides/rtf-to-text.md)** - Conversion workflows and troubleshooting

### Installation Quick Start
```bash
# Install pipx (if not already installed)
pip install pipx
pipx ensurepath
# Then install the toolkit
pipx install kp-analysis-toolkit

# Verify installation
kpat_cli --help
```

### Usage Examples
```bash
# Process audit scripts output
kpat_cli scripts --conf audit-windows.yaml

# Expand Nipper CSV files  
kpat_cli nipper --in-file network-scan.csv

# Convert RTF configurations
kpat_cli rtf-to-text --start-dir ./configs/
```

## Common Audit Workflows

Most security assessments follow these patterns:

**System Analysis Workflow:**

1. Run OS-specific collection scripts on target systems
2. Use Process Scripts module to analyze collected data
3. Review Excel reports for findings

**Network Analysis Workflow:**

1. Export Nipper scan results to CSV format
2. Use Nipper Expander to transform data structure
3. Analyze expanded data with Excel sort/filter and pivot tables

**Network Configuration Analysis Workflow:**

1. Collect device configurations (sometimes in RTF format)
2. Use RTF Converter to standardize to plain text
3. Process text files with Nipper
