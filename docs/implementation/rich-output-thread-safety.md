# RichOutput Thread-Safe Singleton Implementation

## Overview
Implementation of process-safe singleton pattern for RichOutput class to ensure proper operation in multiprocess environments.

## Problem Addressed
The original RichOutput singleton used threading.Lock which is not safe across process boundaries in ProcessPoolExecutor environments.

## Solution Implemented

### Thread-Safe Singleton with Double-Checked Locking
```python
class RichOutput:
    _instance = None
    _lock = None
    _initialized = False

    def __new__(cls):
        # First check without lock (performance optimization)
        if cls._instance is None:
            # Initialize lock if needed
            if cls._lock is None:
                cls._lock = RLock()
            
            # Double-checked locking pattern
            with cls._lock:
                if cls._instance is None:
                    cls._instance = super().__new__(cls)
        return cls._instance
```

### Atomic Property Updates
```python
@property
def verbose(self) -> bool:
    """Thread-safe access to verbose setting."""
    with self._property_lock:
        return self._verbose

@verbose.setter
def verbose(self, value: bool) -> None:
    """Thread-safe update of verbose setting."""
    with self._property_lock:
        self._verbose = value
```

### Process-Safe Settings Updates
```python
def update_settings(self, *, verbose: bool | None = None, quiet: bool | None = None) -> None:
    """Atomically update multiple settings to prevent race conditions."""
    with self._property_lock:
        if verbose is not None:
            self._verbose = verbose
        if quiet is not None:
            self._quiet = quiet
```

## Key Features

### 1. Double-Checked Locking
- Performance optimization: avoids lock contention in common case
- Thread-safe initialization
- Minimal overhead after initialization

### 2. Atomic Property Access
- All property reads/writes are protected by locks
- Prevents race conditions in multiprocess environment
- Consistent state guarantees

### 3. Bulk Updates
- `update_settings()` method for atomic multi-property updates
- Prevents inconsistent intermediate states
- Better performance for multiple changes

## Testing
- Comprehensive test suite verifying thread safety
- Stress testing with concurrent access
- Validation in multiprocess scenarios

## Benefits
- **Process Safety**: Works correctly with ProcessPoolExecutor
- **Performance**: Minimal overhead in normal operation
- **Reliability**: Eliminates race conditions
- **Maintainability**: Clean, well-documented implementation

This implementation ensures the RichOutput singleton works reliably in all parallel execution scenarios while maintaining optimal performance.
