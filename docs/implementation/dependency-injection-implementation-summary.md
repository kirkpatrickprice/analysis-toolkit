## Implementation Summary: Distributed Wiring

This dependency injection implementation plan follows **Distributed Wiring**, which provides the optimal balance of modularity, maintainability, and architectural clarity for the KP Analysis Toolkit.

### Key Implementation Points

#### 1. Architectural Decision: Distributed Wiring

**Why Option B was chosen:**
- **Module Independence**: Each module (process_scripts, nipper_expander, rtf_to_text) controls its own dependency wiring
- **Reduced Coupling**: Modules don't need to know internal wiring details of other modules
- **Clear Separation**: Application container handles cross-module dependencies, module containers handle internal dependencies
- **Testing Benefits**: Each module can be tested in isolation with its own container
- **Team Development**: Different teams can work on different modules without DI conflicts

#### 2. Wiring Responsibility Matrix

| Component | Wiring Responsibility | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| **Application Container** | Cross-module service orchestration | Core services, module container composition |
| **Process Scripts Container** | Internal process scripts wiring | Search engine, system detection, YAML config services |
| **Nipper Expander Container** | Internal nipper expander wiring | CSV processing, data expansion services |
| **RTF to Text Container** | Internal RTF processing wiring | RTF parsing, text conversion services |
| **Core Containers** | Shared service wiring | RichOutput, file processing, Excel export, parallel processing |

#### 3. Implementation Checklist

**For each module container, ensure the following are implemented:**

✅ **Container Definition**
- [ ] `class ModuleContainer(containers.DeclarativeContainer)` with proper dependencies
- [ ] All module-specific services defined as providers
- [ ] Cross-module dependencies declared as `providers.DependenciesContainer()`

✅ **Wiring Function**
- [ ] `def wire_module_container() -> None` function implemented
- [ ] Function wires container to all relevant module files
- [ ] Function is called by application container orchestration

✅ **Configuration Function** 
- [ ] `def configure_module_container()` function implemented
- [ ] Function receives cross-module dependencies as parameters
- [ ] Function overrides dependency containers with actual instances

✅ **Module Integration**
- [ ] Module container imported in application container
- [ ] Module wiring function called by `wire_module_containers()`
- [ ] Module configuration function called with proper dependencies

#### 4. Service Architecture Patterns

**Protocol-Based Design:**
- All services define clear protocols for their dependencies
- Implementation classes are injected via protocols
- This enables easy testing and swapping of implementations

**Hierarchical Service Organization:**
- Core services (shared): `core/services/`
- Module services (specific): `{module}/services/`
- Service implementations: Embedded in services or `utils/`

**Container Hierarchy:**
- Application container → orchestrates all containers
- Core containers → provide shared services
- Module containers → handle module-specific dependencies

#### 5. Testing Strategy

**Module-Level Testing:**
```python
# Example: Testing process scripts module in isolation
def test_process_scripts_module():
    # Create test container with mocked dependencies
    test_container = ProcessScriptsContainer()
    test_container.core.override(mock_core_container)
    test_container.wire(modules=["test_module"])
    
    # Test module functionality in isolation
    service = test_container.process_scripts_service()
    # ... test assertions
```

**Cross-Module Integration Testing:**
```python
# Example: Testing full application with real containers
def test_full_application():
    # Use real application container setup
    initialize_dependency_injection(verbose=False, quiet=True)
    
    # Test end-to-end functionality
    # ... integration test assertions
```

#### 6. Migration Path

**Phase 1: Core Services (Weeks 1-2)**
1. Implement core containers (CoreContainer, FileProcessingContainer, ExcelExportContainer)
2. Refactor RichOutput to use DI
3. Update shared services to use injected dependencies

**Phase 2: Module Containers (Weeks 3-5)**
1. Implement process scripts container and wiring
2. Implement nipper expander container and wiring  
3. Implement RTF to text container and wiring
4. Update each module to use DI

**Phase 3: Integration (Week 6)**
1. Implement application container orchestration
2. Update CLI to use distributed wiring initialization
3. Update tests to use new DI system
4. Performance testing and optimization

### Benefits Realized

With Option B implementation, the toolkit achieves:

1. **Maintainability**: Each module can evolve independently without affecting others
2. **Testability**: Modules can be tested in isolation with mocked dependencies
3. **Performance**: Only necessary services are instantiated when modules are used
4. **Team Development**: Clear boundaries enable parallel development
5. **Architectural Clarity**: Separation between shared and module-specific concerns
6. **Extensibility**: New modules can be added without modifying existing containers

This distributed wiring approach provides a solid foundation for the KP Analysis Toolkit's growth and maintenance while maintaining clean architectural boundaries and excellent developer experience.
