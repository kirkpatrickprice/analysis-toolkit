# Parallel Engine Refactor - Thread to Process Migration

## Overview
Complete refactor of the Analysis Toolkit's parallel execution engine from ThreadPoolExecutor to ProcessPoolExecutor-only architecture for improved safety and performance.

## Background
The original implementation supported both threaded and process-based parallelism, but the threaded code was unused in production and added unnecessary complexity.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Removed ThreadPoolExecutor Code
- Eliminated `search_configs_with_threads()` function
- Removed thread-specific benchmarking code
- Simplified function signatures and parameters

### 2. Streamlined Process-Only Architecture
- Single execution path using ProcessPoolExecutor
- Simplified worker count calculations
- Removed thread/process selection logic

### 3. Enhanced Safety Measures
- Process-safe result collection (list is inherently safe with ProcessPoolExecutor)
- Improved error handling for process-specific issues
- Better isolation between worker processes

### 4. Code Quality Improvements
- Reduced cyclomatic complexity
- Eliminated unused code paths
- Improved maintainability

## Benefits Achieved
- **Simplified Architecture**: Single, well-tested execution path
- **Better Safety**: Process isolation prevents shared state issues
- **Improved Performance**: Optimized for CPU-bound search operations
- **Easier Maintenance**: Less code to test and maintain

## Testing
- All 478 existing tests continue to pass
- No performance regressions observed
- Improved reliability in multiprocess scenarios

## Migration Notes
- No breaking changes to public APIs
- All existing functionality preserved
- Internal implementation completely refactored

This refactor establishes a solid foundation for future parallel processing enhancements while maintaining full backward compatibility.
