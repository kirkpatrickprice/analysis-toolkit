# Progress Bar Fixed-Width Enhancement

## Overview
Implementation of fixed-width column formatting for progress bar completion messages to improve UI stability and readability.

## Problem Addressed
Variable-length search configuration names caused the progress bar to shift and jump as different searches completed, creating a poor user experience.

## Solution Implemented

### Fixed-Width Formatting
```python
# Calculate maximum width needed for all search config names
max_name_width = max(
    len(getattr(config, "name", "Unknown")) for config in search_configs
)

# Use consistent formatting in progress updates
description=f"Completed: {config_name:<{max_name_width}}"
```

### Benefits
- **Stable UI**: Progress bar columns remain aligned
- **Better Readability**: Consistent formatting makes status easier to scan
- **Professional Appearance**: Clean, organized progress display

## Before and After

## Implementation Details
- Width calculation performed once at startup
- Applied consistently across all progress update points
- Works with cancellation and error states as well

## Performance Impact
- Minimal: Single calculation at initialization
- No runtime performance overhead
- Improved user experience with stable display

This enhancement significantly improves the professional appearance and usability of the progress reporting system.
