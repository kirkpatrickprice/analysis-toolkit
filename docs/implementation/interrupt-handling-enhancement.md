# Enhanced Interrupt Handling Implementation

## Problem Identified

When implementing the hybrid interrupt handling approach, a critical issue was discovered during real-world testing:

**Issue**: After pressing CTRL-C, users received immediate feedback ("Interrupt received! Finishing current searches..."), but the application appeared to "hang" with high CPU usage. 

**Root Cause**: The interrupt handling only affected the coordination loop, but **running worker processes continued executing until completion**. The ProcessPoolExecutor context manager waits for all running processes to finish before exiting, creating the illusion of a hang.

## Enhanced Solution

### 1. Improved Cancellation Logic

**Before:**
```python
# Tried to cancel with 0.1s timeout, marked as "Cancelled" if timeout
future.result(timeout=0.1)  # This was misleading!
```

**After:**
```python
# Properly distinguish between cancelled and running futures
if future.cancel():
    # Actually cancelled
    mark_as_cancelled()
else:
    # Running - wait for completion with progress updates
    running_futures.append(future)
```

### 2. Clear Communication to Users

**Enhanced User Experience:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è  Interrupt received! Finishing current searches and cancelling remaining...
üîÑ Cancelling 6 remaining searches...
‚úÖ Successfully cancelled 4 pending searches
‚è≥ Waiting for 2 running searches to complete...
üí° Press CTRL-C again to force immediate termination (may lose data)
```

### 3. Two-Level Interrupt Handling

**First CTRL-C**: Graceful cancellation
- Cancels pending futures immediately
- Waits for running processes to complete naturally
- Updates progress bar showing actual status

**Second CTRL-C**: Force termination
- Immediately abandons waiting for running processes
- Marks remaining as "Terminated" in progress
- Exits quickly (may lose in-progress data)

**Third CTRL-C**: System default (hard kill)
- Restores default signal handler
- Forces immediate process termination

### 4. Technical Implementation

#### Enhanced InterruptHandler
```python
class InterruptHandler:
    def __init__(self, rich_output):
        self.interrupted = False
        self.force_terminate = False  # New: second-level interrupt
        self._lock = mp.Lock()

    def handle_interrupt(self, signum, frame):
        with self._lock:
            if not self.interrupted:
                self.interrupted = True
                self.show_graceful_message()
            elif not self.force_terminate:
                self.force_terminate = True
                self.show_force_terminate_message()
            else:
                # Restore default handler and re-raise
                self.restore_default_and_kill()
```

#### Smart Cancellation
```python
def _handle_cancellation(remaining_futures, context, interrupt_handler):
    cancelled_count = 0
    running_futures = []
    
    # Phase 1: Cancel pending futures
    for future in remaining_futures:
        if future.cancel():
            cancelled_count += 1
            update_progress_as_cancelled()
        else:
            running_futures.append(future)
    
    # Phase 2: Wait for running futures (with force termination check)
    if running_futures:
        show_waiting_message()
        for future in running_futures:
            if interrupt_handler.should_force_terminate():
                abandon_remaining_and_exit()
                break
            wait_for_completion_with_progress()
```

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. Transparency
- Users now understand exactly what's happening
- Clear distinction between cancelled vs. running vs. completed
- Real-time progress updates during wait periods

### 2. Control
- **Graceful**: First CTRL-C for clean cancellation
- **Forceful**: Second CTRL-C for immediate exit
- **Emergency**: Third CTRL-C for hard termination

### 3. Data Safety
- Running searches complete naturally when possible
- Completed results are always preserved
- Users explicitly choose to abandon data with second CTRL-C

### 4. Responsiveness
- Immediate feedback on first interrupt
- Continuous progress updates during waiting
- Option to force immediate termination if needed

## User Experience Flow

```
$ kpat process-scripts --parallel 4
üöÄ Executing 8 search configurations...

[User presses CTRL-C after 3 searches complete]

‚ö†Ô∏è  Interrupt received! Finishing current searches and cancelling remaining...
üîÑ Cancelling 5 remaining searches...
‚úÖ Successfully cancelled 3 pending searches
‚è≥ Waiting for 2 running searches to complete...
üí° Press CTRL-C again to force immediate termination (may lose data)

[User waits - sees progress updates as running searches complete]

Completed: NetworkScan_Advanced    [4/8]
Completed: SecurityAudit_Full      [5/8]

‚ö†Ô∏è  Search interrupted by user. Completed 5 out of 8 searches.
```

**OR if user is impatient:**

```
[User presses CTRL-C again during waiting]

üõë Force termination - abandoning remaining searches
Terminated: NetworkScan_Advanced   [4/8]
Terminated: SecurityAudit_Full     [5/8]

‚ö†Ô∏è  Search interrupted by user. Completed 3 out of 8 searches.
```

## Performance Impact

- **Minimal overhead**: Only affects interrupt handling path
- **No normal operation impact**: Regular execution unchanged
- **Quick cancellation**: Pending futures cancelled immediately
- **Transparent waiting**: Progress updates during completion waits

This enhanced implementation solves the "hanging" perception while providing users with clear control and understanding of what's happening during interruption scenarios.
