## System Overview

The KP Analysis Toolkit follows a modular, service-oriented architecture built on these core principles:

- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive type hints and Pydantic validation throughout
- **Dependency Injection**: Clean separation of concerns through injectable services  
- **Parallel Processing**: Efficient multi-core utilization for large dataset processing
- **Rich User Experience**: Modern CLI with progress indicators and formatted output
- **Testability**: Interface-based design enabling comprehensive testing strategies

## Architecture Overview

The system is organized into several key architectural layers:

### Core Services Layer
Foundation services used across all commands:
- File processing and validation
- Configuration management  
- Error handling and logging
- Progress tracking and reporting

### Application Services Layer  
Command-agnostic business logic:
- Search and filtering operations
- Data transformation pipelines
- Output formatting and export
- Parallel processing orchestration

### Command Services Layer
Command-specific implementations:
- Process Scripts: PowerShell/Bash script analysis
- RTF to Text: Rich Text Format conversion  
- Nipper Expander: Network configuration processing

## Data Flow Architecture

### Service Layer Architecture
- Business logic organization
- Service interfaces
- Processing workflows
- Extension points
