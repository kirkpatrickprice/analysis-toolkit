# Service Package Architecture Pattern

## Overview

This document defines the service package architecture pattern used throughout the KP Analysis Toolkit for organizing dependency injection services. This pattern provides a scalable, maintainable approach for implementing services that may grow in complexity over time.

## Problem Statement

As services evolve and grow in functionality, single-file service implementations can become unwieldy:

- **Large files** become difficult to navigate and understand
- **Mixed concerns** within a single file reduce clarity
- **Testing complexity** increases when multiple concerns are coupled
- **Team collaboration** suffers when multiple developers work on the same large file
- **Code review** becomes more difficult with large, multi-concern files

## Solution: Service Package Pattern

Instead of implementing services as single files, organize them as packages with clear separation of concerns.

## Package Structure

### Basic Service Package Layout

```
core/services/
└── <service_name>/
    ├── __init__.py              # Public API exports
    ├── protocols.py             # Service protocols/interfaces  
    ├── service.py               # Main service orchestrator
    └── <concern>.py             # Feature-specific implementations
```

### Detailed Structure for Complex Services

```
core/services/
└── <service_name>/
    ├── __init__.py              # Public API exports
    ├── protocols.py             # Service protocols/interfaces
    ├── service.py               # Main service orchestrator
    ├── <feature_a>.py           # Feature A implementation
    ├── <feature_b>.py           # Feature B implementation
    ├── <feature_c>.py           # Feature C implementation
    └── utils.py                 # Service-specific utilities (optional)
```

## File Responsibilities

### `__init__.py` - Public API
**Purpose:** Define the public interface that other modules will import.

**Contents:**
- Import and export main service class
- Import and export protocols
- Define `__all__` for explicit public API
- No implementation logic

**Example:**
```python
"""Service name service for [brief description]."""

from .protocols import ServiceProtocol, HelperProtocol
from .service import ServiceNameService

__all__ = [
    "ServiceProtocol",
    "HelperProtocol", 
    "ServiceNameService",
]
```

### `protocols.py` - Interface Definitions
**Purpose:** Define all protocols and interfaces used by the service.

**Contents:**
- Protocol classes defining service interfaces
- Protocol classes for injected dependencies
- Type aliases specific to the service
- No concrete implementations

**Guidelines:**
- Use clear, descriptive protocol names
- Include comprehensive docstrings
- Define minimal, focused interfaces
- Avoid protocol inheritance unless necessary

### `service.py` - Main Orchestrator
**Purpose:** Implement the main service class that orchestrates all functionality.

**Contents:**
- Main service class implementation
- Constructor accepting injected dependencies
- Public methods that delegate to feature implementations
- High-level coordination logic

**Guidelines:**
- Keep orchestration logic minimal
- Delegate implementation details to feature modules
- Focus on coordination rather than implementation
- Maintain clear separation from feature-specific logic

### `<feature>.py` - Feature Implementations
**Purpose:** Implement specific functionality domains within the service.

**Contents:**
- Classes implementing specific features
- Feature-specific helper functions
- Feature-specific constants and configuration
- Implementation details for one concern

**Guidelines:**
- One primary concern per file
- Clear, descriptive filenames
- Focused, cohesive functionality
- Minimal dependencies on other feature files

## Architecture Principles

### 1. Separation of Concerns
Each file should have a single, well-defined responsibility:
- **Protocols:** Interface definitions only
- **Service:** Orchestration and public API only  
- **Features:** Implementation of specific functionality

### 2. Dependency Direction
Dependencies should flow inward toward the service:
```
External Code → Service → Feature Implementations
             ↓
          Protocols ← Dependencies
```

### 3. Public API Control
Only expose what's necessary through `__init__.py`:
- Main service class
- Essential protocols
- Important type aliases
- Hide implementation details

### 4. Testability
Structure should support easy testing:
- Feature implementations can be tested in isolation
- Service orchestration can be tested with mocked features
- Protocols enable easy mocking of dependencies

## When to Use Service Packages

### Use Service Package When:
- **Service has multiple distinct concerns** (>3 major feature areas)
- **File size exceeds ~300-400 lines** 
- **Multiple developers work on the service**
- **Service implements complex business logic**
- **Testing requires isolation of different concerns**

### Use Single File When:
- **Service is simple and focused** (<300 lines)
- **Service has a single primary concern**
- **Service is unlikely to grow significantly**
- **Team is small and coordination is not an issue**

## Container Integration

Service packages integrate seamlessly with dependency injection containers:

```python
# Container references point to specific implementations
class ServiceContainer(containers.DeclarativeContainer):
    
    # Feature implementations
    feature_a = providers.Factory(
        "package.core.services.service_name.feature_a.FeatureAImpl"
    )
    
    feature_b = providers.Factory(
        "package.core.services.service_name.feature_b.FeatureBImpl"  
    )
    
    # Main service
    service_name_service = providers.Factory(
        "package.core.services.service_name.ServiceNameService",
        feature_a=feature_a,
        feature_b=feature_b,
        # ... other dependencies
    )
```

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- **Feature tests:** Test individual feature implementations in isolation
- **Service tests:** Test service orchestration with mocked features
- **Integration tests:** Test service with real feature implementations

### Test File Organization
```
tests/unit/core/services/
└── <service_name>/
    ├── test_service.py          # Main service orchestration tests
    ├── test_feature_a.py        # Feature A implementation tests
    ├── test_feature_b.py        # Feature B implementation tests
    └── conftest.py              # Shared test fixtures
```

## Migration from Single File

### Step 1: Create Package Structure
1. Create service package directory
2. Move existing service file to `service.py`
3. Create `__init__.py` with exports
4. Extract protocols to `protocols.py`

### Step 2: Extract Features
1. Identify distinct concerns in existing service
2. Create feature files for each concern
3. Move implementation logic to feature files
4. Update service to use feature implementations

### Step 3: Update Dependencies
1. Update container provider references
2. Update import statements in dependent modules
3. Update test imports and structure
4. Verify all functionality works as expected

## Best Practices

### Naming Conventions
- **Package names:** Use snake_case matching service purpose
- **File names:** Use descriptive names for feature areas
- **Class names:** Use clear, domain-specific names
- **Protocol names:** End with "Protocol" or use descriptive interfaces

### Documentation
- **Package docstring:** Explain service purpose and major features
- **File docstrings:** Describe specific functionality
- **Class docstrings:** Detail responsibilities and usage
- **Method docstrings:** Standard format with args/returns

### Dependencies
- **Minimize cross-feature dependencies** within the package
- **Use constructor injection** for external dependencies
- **Avoid circular imports** between feature files
- **Keep feature files focused** and independent

## Benefits

### Maintainability
- **Easier navigation:** Find specific functionality quickly
- **Clearer responsibilities:** Each file has focused purpose
- **Reduced complexity:** Smaller files are easier to understand
- **Better organization:** Related functionality grouped logically

### Collaboration
- **Parallel development:** Multiple developers can work simultaneously
- **Reduced conflicts:** Changes isolated to specific feature areas
- **Clearer ownership:** Features can have dedicated maintainers
- **Better code reviews:** Smaller, focused changes

### Testing
- **Isolated testing:** Test features independently
- **Faster feedback:** Run specific test suites
- **Better coverage:** More targeted test strategies
- **Easier mocking:** Clear interfaces for test doubles

### Scalability
- **Graceful growth:** Add features without affecting existing code
- **Modular architecture:** Easy to refactor or replace features
- **Clear boundaries:** Well-defined interfaces between components
- **Future-proof:** Structure supports long-term evolution

## Conclusion

The service package pattern provides a scalable, maintainable approach to organizing dependency injection services. By separating concerns into focused files within a cohesive package structure, teams can build robust services that grow gracefully over time while maintaining clarity and testability.

This pattern should be applied proactively to services that are expected to grow in complexity, rather than waiting until single-file implementations become unwieldy. The upfront organizational investment pays significant dividends in long-term maintainability and team productivity.
