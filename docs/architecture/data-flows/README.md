# Data Flows Architecture

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for the data processing and workflow orchestration architecture of the KP Analysis Toolkit.

## Documentation Overview

### Core Documentation

- **[Data Flows Architecture](data-flows-architecture.md)** - Complete guide to pipeline-based data processing, service orchestration, and workflow coordination patterns

## Architecture Highlights

### Pipeline-Based Processing

Data flows through well-defined pipelines with discrete stages:

- **Input Validation**: File existence, format validation, encoding detection
- **Data Ingestion**: CSV parsing, DataFrame creation, schema validation
- **Data Transformation**: Filtering, expansion, enrichment, aggregation
- **Output Generation**: Excel export, formatting, multi-sheet coordination

### Core Flow Patterns

- **File Processing Pipeline**: Foundational flow for all file-based operations
- **CSV Processing Pipeline**: Specialized pipeline with DataFrame validation
- **Excel Export Pipeline**: Complex multi-sheet workbook generation
- **Batch Processing Flow**: Parallel processing coordination with progress tracking

### Module-Specific Flows

- **Process Scripts Flow**: Search operations with system detection and Excel export
- **Nipper Expander Flow**: CSV expansion and data transformation workflows
- **RTF to Text Flow**: Document conversion with encoding detection

## Service Integration

### Core Services Coordination

Data flows orchestrate multiple services through dependency injection:

- File processing service for validation and metadata generation
- CSV processing service for DataFrame operations
- Excel export service for workbook creation
- Rich output service for progress reporting and error display

### Error Handling Architecture

- **Progressive Error Handling**: Multi-stage error detection with recovery strategies
- **Error Aggregation**: Comprehensive error collection and reporting
- **Validation Flows**: Multi-stage validation with context management

## Performance Optimization

### Scalability Features

- **Stream Processing**: Memory-efficient handling of large datasets
- **Lazy Evaluation**: Deferred execution for expensive operations
- **Parallel Processing**: Multi-worker coordination with progress tracking
- **Batch Operations**: Efficient processing of file collections

### Monitoring and Observability

- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress reporting with Rich library integration
- **Performance Metrics**: Execution time and resource usage collection
- **Error Reporting**: Structured error logging with context preservation

## Integration Patterns

### Dependency Injection

Data flows integrate seamlessly with the DI container through:

- Service dependency resolution
- Configuration injection
- Protocol-based service interfaces
- Module-specific service extensions

### Future Extensibility

- **Plugin Architecture**: Dynamic flow registration and custom processing stages
- **Workflow Engine**: Declarative workflow definition and visual design support
- **External Integration**: Database connections and network resource handling

## Key Benefits

- **Modularity**: Clear separation of processing stages and concerns
- **Scalability**: Support for parallel processing and large datasets
- **Reliability**: Comprehensive error handling and recovery strategies
- **Observability**: Built-in progress tracking and performance metrics
- **Extensibility**: Plugin support and service composition patterns
