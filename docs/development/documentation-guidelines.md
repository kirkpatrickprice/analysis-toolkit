# Documentation Guidelines

## Purpose
This guide establishes standards for maintaining comprehensive documentation of implementation changes, architectural decisions, and development processes.

## Documentation Structure

### `/docs/architecture/`
- High-level system design documents
- Component interaction diagrams
- Design patterns and principles
- Cross-cutting concerns

### `/docs/implementation/`
- Detailed implementation summaries
- Refactoring documentation
- Technical deep-dives
- Performance optimization notes

### `/docs/development/`
- Developer guides and workflows
- Coding standards and best practices
- Testing strategies
- CI/CD documentation

## Implementation Summary Template

When making significant changes to the codebase, create an implementation summary using this template:

```markdown
# [Feature/Change Name] - [Brief Description]

## Overview
Brief description of what was implemented and why.

## Problem Addressed
What issue or need drove this implementation?

## Solution Implemented
### 1. Key Change 1
Description and code examples

### 2. Key Change 2
Description and code examples

## Benefits Achieved
- Bullet points of concrete benefits
- Performance improvements
- Maintainability gains
- User experience improvements

## Testing
- Test coverage details
- Performance validation
- Compatibility verification

## Migration Notes
- Breaking changes (if any)
- Upgrade considerations
- Backward compatibility notes
```

## When to Create Documentation

### Required Documentation
- Major architectural changes
- Performance optimizations
- Security enhancements
- API changes
- Complex refactoring

### Recommended Documentation
- Bug fixes with broad impact
- New utility functions
- Configuration changes
- Deployment process updates

## File Naming Conventions

### Implementation Summaries
- Use kebab-case: `feature-name-implementation.md`
- Include date if multiple iterations: `feature-name-2025-06.md`
- Be descriptive: `parallel-engine-refactor.md` not `engine-fix.md`

### Architecture Documents
- Use descriptive names: `system-architecture.md`
- Include scope: `search-engine-design.md`
- Version when needed: `api-design-v2.md`

## Content Guidelines

### Writing Style
- Be concise but comprehensive
- Use code examples where helpful
- Include before/after comparisons
- Document the "why" not just the "what"

### Technical Details
- Include performance impact
- Document testing approach
- Note any limitations or trade-offs
- Provide migration guidance

### Maintenance
- Update documentation when implementations change
- Archive outdated documents rather than deleting
- Cross-reference related documents

## Tools and Automation

### Document Generation
- Consider automating documentation from code comments
- Use consistent formatting tools
- Validate links and references

### Review Process
- Include documentation in code reviews
- Verify accuracy of technical details
- Ensure consistency with existing docs

This documentation system ensures that valuable implementation knowledge is preserved and easily accessible to current and future developers.
