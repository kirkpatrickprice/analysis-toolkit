# Gradual MyPy Type Checking Implementation Plan

## Current State Analysis

Your current `pyproject.toml` has very strict mypy settings:
- `strict = true` - Enables all optional error codes
- `warn_return_any = true` - Warns about functions returning Any
- `warn_unused_configs = true` - Warns about unused mypy configurations

This approach, while ideal for new code, can be overwhelming for existing codebases.

## Recommended Gradual Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Baseline Configuration (Immediate)
Create a more permissive baseline that allows you to catch real errors without being overwhelmed by missing type hints.

### Phase 2: Module-by-Module Strictness (Ongoing)
Use mypy's per-module configuration to gradually increase strictness for specific modules as you add type hints.

### Phase 3: Full Strict Mode (Future)
Once all critical modules have type hints, re-enable full strict mode.

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Update pyproject.toml with Baseline Configuration

Replace the current strict configuration with a more permissive baseline that focuses on real errors rather than missing annotations.

### Step 2: Create mypy.ini for Advanced Configuration

While pyproject.toml works for basic settings, mypy.ini provides more granular control for per-module settings.

### Step 3: Set Up Type Checking Workflow

Create scripts and VS Code tasks to run type checking at different strictness levels.

### Step 4: Establish Priority Order

Start with the most critical modules (models, core utilities) and work outward.

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Immediate Value**: Catch real type errors without being overwhelmed
2. **Incremental Progress**: Add type hints module by module
3. **Flexible Strictness**: Different modules can have different strictness levels
4. **Maintainable**: Changes are manageable and don't break existing workflows
5. **Future-Ready**: Easy migration path to full strict mode

## Module Priority Order

1. **Models** (`src/kp_analysis_toolkit/models/`) - Already mostly typed
2. **Core Utilities** (`src/kp_analysis_toolkit/utils/`) - High impact, reusable
3. **CLI Commands** (`src/kp_analysis_toolkit/cli/`) - User-facing, critical
4. **Process Scripts** (`src/kp_analysis_toolkit/process_scripts/`) - Complex logic
5. **Legacy Modules** - Last priority, may use ignore patterns

## Monitoring Progress

- Use mypy reports to track coverage
- Set up CI checks that prevent regression
- Regular reviews of type hint coverage
