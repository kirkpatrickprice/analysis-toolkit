# Test Directory Organization Analysis and Recommendations

## Current Test Directory Structure

The following represents the current state of the `tests/` directory after migration and reorganization:

```

## Test Category Descriptions

### `tests/conftest.py`
**Purpose**: Central pytest configuration and shared fixtures

**Contains**:
- Shared fixtures for common test dependencies
- Mock objects for file system operations
- CLI test runners and temporary workspace setup
- System mock objects for cross-platform testing
- Test data directory configuration

### `tests/unit/` - Unit Tests
**Purpose**: Test individual functions, classes, and methods in isolation

**Characteristics**:
- Fast execution (< 1 second per test)
- No external dependencies (files, network, databases)
- Use mocks for all dependencies
- Focus on single units of functionality

**Subdirectories**:
- `cli/commands/` - Unit tests for individual CLI command implementations
- `cli/common/` - Unit tests for shared CLI utilities (file selection, help intercept, option groups)
- `cli/utils/` - Unit tests for CLI helper functions (table layouts, formatting)
- `core/` - Unit tests for dependency injection containers and core services
- `models/` - Unit tests for Pydantic base models and validation
- `nipper_expander/` - Unit tests for Nipper expansion processor logic
- `process_scripts/` - Unit tests for the process scripts module
  - `models/` - Unit tests for process scripts data models and validation
  - `regex/platforms/` - Platform-specific regex pattern validation tests
- `rtf_to_text/` - Unit tests for RTF to text conversion processor
- `utils/` - Unit tests for utility functions (Excel, file encoding, version checking)

### `tests/integration/` - Integration Tests
**Purpose**: Test interactions between multiple components

**Characteristics**:
- Test real component interactions
- May use temporary files or test data
- Moderate execution time (1-10 seconds per test)
- Focus on interface contracts between components

**Subdirectories**:
- `cli/` - CLI workflow integration tests that verify command-line interface interactions
- `core/` - Core service integration tests for dependency injection and service coordination
- `workflows/` - Multi-step workflow integration tests that span multiple modules

### `tests/e2e/` - End-to-End Tests
**Purpose**: Test complete user workflows from input to output

**Characteristics**:
- Test the full system as a user would use it
- Use real files and data from `testdata/`
- Longer execution time (10+ seconds per test)
- Focus on user scenarios and business requirements

**Guidelines**:
- Test complete command-line workflows
- Use actual input files from `testdata/`
- Verify final output files and formats

### `tests/regression/` - Regression Tests
**Purpose**: Prevent previously fixed bugs from reoccurring

**Characteristics**:
- Test specific bug scenarios and edge cases
- Include detailed documentation of the original issue
- May be slow but comprehensive
- Focus on previously problematic areas

**Guidelines**:
- Include issue references in test documentation
- Test exact scenarios that caused original bugs
- Maintain these tests even if code changes

### `tests/performance/` - Performance Tests
**Purpose**: Ensure system performance meets requirements

**Characteristics**:
- Test with large datasets and files
- Measure execution time and memory usage
- May be slow and resource-intensive
- Run separately from other test categories

**Guidelines**:
- Use realistic large datasets
- Set performance benchmarks
- Monitor for performance regressions
