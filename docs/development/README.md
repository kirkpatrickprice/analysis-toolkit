## Development

### Development Environment
- **Primary development platform**: Windows
- **Testing**: Comprehensive CI testing on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Cross-platform compatibility**: Ensured through automated testing

While development is primarily conducted on Windows, the toolkit is designed to be cross-platform compatible. Continuous Integration (CI) testing is performed against all three major operating systems (Windows, macOS, and Linux) to ensure proper functionality across platforms.

### Running from Source
For development or testing purposes:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/kirkpatrickprice/analysis-toolkit.git
cd analysis-toolkit

# Install with uv (recommended)
uv sync

# Or install with pip
pip install -e .

# Run directly
python -m kp_analysis_toolkit.cli --help
```

### Dependencies
The toolkit automatically installs required dependencies:
- **pandas** and **openpyxl** for Excel processing
- **PyYAML** for configuration files
- **click** for command-line interface
- **pydantic** for data validation
- **charset-normalizer** for encoding detection
- **striprtf** for RTF processing

### Publishing and Releases
The toolkit uses automated publishing to PyPI:
- **Cross-platform testing**: Full test suite runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux before publishing
- **Automatic publishing**: When the version in `src/kp_analysis_toolkit/__init__.py` is updated and pushed to the main branch
- **GitHub Actions**: Handles testing, building, and publishing automatically
- **GitHub Releases**: Automatically created with version tags and changelogs
- **Quality assurance**: Cross-platform tests must pass before publishing
