You will tag all code with the appropriate tags to indicate that code was generated by GitHub Copilot. Use comment-based tags in surrounding edited code blocks, like this:
```python

# END AI-GEN

This project uses Pydantic for all data models and data validation.

Data models will inherit from `src.kp_analysis_toolkit.models.base.KPATBaseModel`.  This model inherits from `pydantic.BaseModel` and provides a base structure for all data models used in the KP Analysis Toolkit.

All models should be defined in `src/kp_analysis_toolkit/models/`.  If a model is specific to a particular module, it will be defined in that module's subdirectory `src/kp_analysis_toolkit/<command>/models/`.

All data models will be annotated with type hints, and all fields should have default values or be required.  Use Pydantic's `Field` for additional metadata like descriptions or validation constraints.

All provided input will be validated using Pydantic's validation features. This includes checking types, required fields, and any custom validation logic that may be necessary.

All test data will be created in the `testdata` directory with a structure that mirrors the source data.  This allows for easy testing and validation of the data models and processing logic.
